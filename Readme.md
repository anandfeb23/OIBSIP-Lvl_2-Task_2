# Tribute Page Project [live](https://tributepagemsdhoni.netlify.app/)
 Welcome to the repository for my Tribute Page project completed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Web Development Internship! This project is a dedicated tribute to the legendary cricketer MS Dhoni.

# Project Overview:
This tribute page is a static website that celebrates the life and achievements of MS Dhoni. The page includes key information about his career, personal life, and notable milestones, presented in a visually appealing and responsive design.

# Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the content and layout of the page.
CSS: For styling the page and creating a visually appealing design.
Git/GitHub: For version control and collaboration.
# Future Enhancements:
Add interactive elements such as a photo gallery or slideshow.
Include more multimedia content like interviews and match highlights.
Implement animations and transitions for a more dynamic user experience.
I'm excited to share this tribute page and celebrate the incredible career of MS Dhoni. Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or suggest improvements! ðŸš€
